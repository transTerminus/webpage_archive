### 2012年同性恋者、双性恋者和跨性别者骄傲月

**美利坚合众国总统公告**

普通的美国人一代又一代地带头前进，自豪地、不屈不挠地迈向自由、公正与法律面前完全平等——不仅仅是一些人，而且是所有人的平等。缔造我们的传统的人是这样一些人：他们组织起来、群情激昂并积极倡导变革；他们用爱去战胜仇恨，以希望去抚慰所受的侮辱或伤害；他们努力奋斗去为自己和家人建立一个没有二等公民、没有人被剥夺权利，所有人都自由地按照适合自己的方式去生活和去爱的国家。

同性恋者、双性恋者和跨性别者(LGBT)社区在这一具有美国特性的历程中写下了骄傲的篇章。从那些敢于站出来并大胆直言的勇敢的男女人士，到号召支持平等的工会和信仰领袖、以及挑战不公正的法律并在华盛顿游行的活动人士及倡导者，美国同性恋者、双性恋者和跨性别者及其支持者实现了一度似乎无法想象的夙愿。这个月，我们回顾他们不朽的传统，彰显使进步成为可能的这场运动，并再次承诺确保所有美国人都充分享有自由的福祉。

自我上任以来，本届政府为同性恋者、双性恋者和跨性别者扩大机会、推进平等并为他们提供公平的竞争环境做出了努力。我们为依照《马休‧谢巴德和小詹姆斯·伯德仇恨罪防范法》（Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act）来确保所有人的公正待遇而奋斗，我们并为终止基于性取向和性别的住房歧视采取了行动。我们扩大了同性恋者、双性恋者和跨性别者患者及其亲友的医院探视权，并根据《合理医疗费用法》（Affordable Care Act）的规定，确保保险公司不能再仅仅因为某人是同性恋者、双性恋者或跨性别者而拒绝为其投保。因为我们懂得，同性恋者、双性恋者和跨性别者的权利是人权，因此我们继续争取让国际社会参与推动保护世界各地同性恋者、双性恋者和跨性别者的权利。由于我们废除了“不问不说”的政策，美国同性恋者、双性恋者和跨性别者能够公开地、诚实地为国服役，而不用担心因为他们所爱的人丢掉工作。由于我们必须以己所不欲勿施于人的方式对待他人，因此我个人认为同性恋伴侣应该享有婚姻平等。

为了确保每一个美国人都得到平等对待，无论其性取向或者性别如何，还有很多工作有待完成。本届政府今后将继续努力增进美国同性恋者、双性恋者和跨性别者的权利。这个月，在我们回顾已走过的道路并展望前面的漫漫长路的时候，让我们记住，我们所取得的进步均建立在普通美国人的言行之上。让我们向我们的先辈和今天继续这项努力的人表示敬意；让我们重新致力于这项永无止境的事业——力争建设一个人人平等，人人享有追求幸福并公开地、自由地生活的一切机会而且不受任何约束的国家。

为此，我，美利坚合众国总统巴拉克·欧巴马，以美国宪法和法律赋予我的权力，特此宣布2012年6月为同性恋者、双性恋者和跨性别者骄傲月。我呼吁美国人民消除所有地方存在的歧视，并弘扬美国人民的巨大的多样性。

我谨于公元2012年，即美利坚合众国独立第236年之6月1日，在此亲笔签名为证。

**巴拉克·欧巴马（BARACK OBAMA）**

LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, AND TRANSGENDER PRIDE MONTH, 2012

\- - - - - - -

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

From generation to generation, ordinary Americans have led a proud and inexorable march toward freedom, fairness, and full equality under the law -- not just for some, but for all. Ours is a heritage forged by those who organized, agitated, and advocated for change; who wielded love stronger than hate and hope more powerful than insult or injury; who fought to build for themselves and their families a Nation where no one is a second-class citizen, no one is denied basic rights, and all of us are free to live and love as we see fit.

The lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community has written a proud chapter in this fundamentally American story. From brave men and women who came out and spoke out, to union and faith leaders who rallied for equality, to activists and advocates who challenged unjust laws and marched on Washington, LGBT Americans and allies have achieved what once seemed inconceivable. This month, we reflect on their enduring legacy, celebrate the movement that has made progress possible, and recommit to securing the fullest blessings of freedom for all Americans.

Since I took office, my Administration has worked to broaden opportunity, advance equality, and level the playing field for LGBT people and communities. We have fought to secure justice for all under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act, and we have taken action to end housing discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. We expanded hospital visitation rights for LGBT patients and their loved ones, and under the Affordable Care Act, we ensured that insurance companies will no longer be able to deny coverage to someone just because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. Because we understand that LGBT rights are human rights, we continue to engage with the international community in promoting and protecting the rights of LGBT persons around the world. Because we repealed "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," gay, lesbian, and bisexual Americans can serve their country openly, honestly, and without fear of losing their jobs because of whom they love. And because we must treat others the way we want to be treated, I personally believe in marriage equality for same-sex couples.

More remains to be done to ensure every single American is treated equally, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Moving forward, my Administration will continue its work to advance the rights of LGBT Americans. This month, as we reflect on how far we have come and how far we have yet to go, let us recall that the progress we have made is built on the words and deeds of ordinary Americans. Let us pay tribute to those who came before us, and those who continue their work today; and let us rededicate ourselves to a task that is unending -- the pursuit of a Nation where all are equal, and all have the full and unfettered opportunity to pursue happiness and live openly and freely.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2012 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month. I call upon the people of the United States to eliminate prejudice everywhere it exists, and to celebrate the great diversity of the American people.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

**BARACK OBAMA**
