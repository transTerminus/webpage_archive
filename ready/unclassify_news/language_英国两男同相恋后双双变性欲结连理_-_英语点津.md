两名相爱的男性双双接受了彻底的变性手术成为了女性，两人正打算结婚。

Parma Bertoli, 59, and partner Stephanie Nickles, 43, started a relationship when they were both men in 2004.

59岁的帕尔玛·巴图里和43岁的斯蒂芬妮·尼克尔斯都曾是男同性恋，二人相恋于2004年。

Stephanie underwent a full sex change in 2006 after having the procedure funded by the NHS while Parma went under the knife to become a woman in 2008.

2006年，斯蒂芬妮在英国国家医疗服务体系的资助下做了变性手术，帕尔玛也在2008年变性成为女人。

The couple, who live in Warndon, Worcester, had their birth certificates changed to reflect their new female identities.

这对情侣现居于伍斯特市的沃恩顿，两人的出生证明已做修改，显示她们为女性。

Tragically, they were forced to bring the big day forward after Parma was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour last October and was given less than 12 months to live.

然而天妒有情人，去年10月，帕尔玛被确诊患有脑肿瘤，而且只有不到1年的时间了。于是她们决定将婚期提前到下个月。

Parma, a former meat hygiene inspector, said: "Steph and I got together when we were both men in 2004 and lived together as men.

帕尔玛曾是一名肉食卫生检验员。她说，“斯蒂芬妮和我是在2004年认识的，之后就在一起生活了。当时我们俩还都是男儿身。

"Steph was in pre-op so was living as a woman and I made the change soon after.

“她先做了变性手术，不久后我也做了。

"Today we are still in love as women." To us, gender is not an issue in our relationship. We are just two people who met and tried to help each other along.

“变性之后的我们依然相爱。对于我们而言，性别并不影响我们的感情。我们就是彼此相遇而且愿意相互扶持的两个人。

"I know I have a very limited amount of time left but it would mean the world to both of us to get married - it would be absolutely brilliant."

“我知道留给我的时间很有限，但是只要我们俩能结婚、能在一起，我们就仿佛拥有了全世界。那就是最棒的事了。”

The couple got engaged while looking for jewellery in 2009 when Parma suddenly got down on one knee.

帕尔玛和斯蒂芬妮是在2009年订婚的。当时她们正在看珠宝首饰，帕尔玛突然单腿下跪向斯蒂芬妮求婚。

Stephanie added: "We were out browsing commitment rings in a jewellers and when I turned round from a display cabinet I saw Parma down on one knee.

斯蒂芬妮接着说道，“那时我们在一家珠宝店看那些订婚戒指。我刚从一个柜台前转过身来就看到帕尔玛单腿跪在那儿。

"She just said to me 'will you marry me?' and of course I said yes. We bought our engagement rings there and then. The staff in the shop clapped, it was a wonderful moment."

她问我‘嫁给我，好吗？’我说好。然后我们在那家店里买了订婚戒指。那里的店员为我们鼓掌。那一刻真是太美妙了。”

But their life together was struck with tragedy when Parma started suffering severe headaches at the beginning of last year.

然而厄运不幸降临。去年年初，帕尔玛开始觉得头痛。

Doctors diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive malignant brain tumour - but despite undergoing surgery she was told it was untreatable.

后来医生诊断她得了多形成性胶质细胞瘤，即一种侵略性的恶性肿瘤。而且医生告诉她，即便手术也无法治愈这种疾病。

Last October medics at the Gloucestershire Oncology Centre broke the devastating news that she has less than 12 months to live.

去年10月，格洛斯特郡（Gloucestershire）肿瘤中心传来噩耗——帕尔玛只有不到一年的时间了。

Stephanie, who gave up her modelling career to care for Parma, said: "To get married would be such a huge thing for us and would make our lives whole in a way.

斯蒂芬妮放弃了她的模特生涯并在家照顾帕尔玛。她说，“结婚对我们来说是件大事。它在某种程度上让我们的生命变得完整。

"We want to get married because we love each other and we are not sure if Parma will be here next year.

“我们结婚是因为我们彼此相爱。我们不确定帕尔玛还能不能活到明年。

"But we have not got the funds and we don't even have the money to buy rings."

“我们现在还没有拿到医疗基金，也没有钱买结婚戒指。”

The couple, who are hoping to get hitched at Worcester registry office next month, are now appealing for help and donations to make their dream wedding come true.

这对恋人希望下个月在伍斯特婚姻登记处登记结婚。现在她们希望得到人们的捐助以实现她们梦寐以求的婚礼。

Parma added: "My fiance has always wanted a special occasion and we are really having to bring it forward because my situation is quite bad. I am very lucky to have got this far through the support of my partner."

帕尔玛说道，“斯蒂芬妮总是想拥有一个特别的时刻，而我们又不得不将婚期提前，因为我的状况实在不怎么乐观。有她支持我走到现在，我感觉自己很幸运。”
